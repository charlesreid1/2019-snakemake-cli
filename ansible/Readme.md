# Ansible + Snakemake

This directory contains Ansible playbooks for setting up
compute nodes to run Snakemake workflows.

This `2019-snakemake-cli` repository can use Ansible to 
run a command line interface from a control node 
(a laptop or personal computer), and carry out the actual
compute tasks elsewhere, on remote compute nodes.

**Ansible** is used to automate the configuration and
deployment of compute nodes.

**Snakemake** is used to run tasks on the compute nodes.
